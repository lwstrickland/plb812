conda install orthofinder was used to download the orthofinder program in its own conda environment.

Three protein datasets were downloaded from Phytozome, one from each of the following species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Amborella trichopoda, and Oryzae sativa. These were decompressed into simple .fa files and renamed -> Athaliana.fa, Atrichopoda.fa, and Osativa.fa. These were placed into their own directory (named 'orthofinder_usage').

Orthofinder was used to identify orthogroups between these three species with the following usage: orthofinder -f orthofinder_usage

This yielded a number of directories, one of which was named Phylogenetic_Heirarchical_Orthogroups, containing a tab-separated filed titled N0.tsv.
This file contained the 17404 total orthogroups identified (counted with 'wc -l N0.tsv').
Within this list, a rice gene within the orthogroup for the Arabidopsis gene encoding chalcone synthase was identified (identified with 'grep AT5G13930 N0.tsv').
