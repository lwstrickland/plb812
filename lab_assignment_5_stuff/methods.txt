htseq-count was used to generate read counts for each gene in the Brachypodium distachyon ABR8 annotation. Within my job script, the htseq-count command was as follows:
htseq-count -f bam -r pos -s yes ${i}_aligned.bam ~/plb812/Phytozome/PhytozomeV13/BdistachyonABR8/v1/annotation/BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.ABR8.1.gene.gtf > htseq_${i}.txt
* -f bam: indicates the input files as alignment files in the BAM format.
* -r pos: indicates that the alignments have been sorted by their position within the genome.
* -s yes: indicates that the RNA-seq dataset is stranded forward library. Although not explicitly stated in the research paper, the use of the TruSeq library preparation seems to suggest that the more advanced method (stranded, in contrast to unstranded) was employed.
* ${i}: calls each of the bam files generated from HISAT2 splice-aware alignment as inputs, as well as defines the name of the output txt file, by SRA#
    * Example: SRR8618232_aligned.bam —> htseq_SRR8618232.txt

The txt files generated by htseq-count display the read counts per gene in the format of a simple table. These tables were imported into R as individual files (6 txt files total) and named according to their treatment and biological replicate #.
* Example: The read count table of htseq_SRR8618232.txt was imported into R as Control-1.txt

The R package DESeq2—designed to call differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data—was installed, and a DESeq2 object was created. The DESeq2 pipeline was used to:
1. call differentially expressed genes between the two treatment groups (Control = well-watered; Drought = drought-stressed) at an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05, and
2. create an MA (Volcano) plot of the data.

After performing the DESeq2 pipeline, only 1 differentially expressed gene was identified at the adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05. I recognize this result to almost certainly be incorrect. Before Lab Assignment 6 (GO term enrichment) is due, I will have this problem figured out, as I will need to in order to perform Lab Assignment 6.
