1. Genome
* Genome for Brachypodium distachyon (genotype ABR8) and accompanying genome annotation downloaded from Phytozome to plb812 directory within my plb812 conda environment on the HPCC:
    * Genome: BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.fa.gz
    * Genome annotation: BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.ABR8.1.gene.gff3.gz
* Downloaded files unzipped:
    * B. distachyon genome assembly: unzip download.20220920.173032.zip
    * B. distachyon genome annotation: unzip download.20220920.173313.zip
* Directions followed to fa.gz file (genome assembly) and gff3.gz (genome annotation):
    * B. distachyon genome assembly: ~/plb812/Phytozome/PhytozomeV13/BdistachyonABR8/v1/assembly/BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.fa.gz
    * B. distachyon genome annotation: ~/plb812/Phytozome/PhytozomeV13/BdistachyonABR8/v1/annotation/BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.ABR8.1.gene.gff3.gz
* Both .gz files were decompressed:
    * Assembly: gzip -d BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.fa.gz
    * Annotation: gzip -d BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.ABR8.1.gene.gff3.gz
* Files were viewed on command line to obtain screenshots:
    * Assembly: more BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.fa
    * Annotation: more BdistachyonABR8_356_v1.ABR8.1.gene.gff3

2. RNA-seq data
* SRA numbers for both RNA-seq datasets were found on the NCBI SRA Database
    * SRA Accession #: SRR8618232 (T1 Control RNA-seq dataset)
    * SRA Accession #: SRR8618235 (T1 Treatment RNA-seq dataset)
* Datasets were “prefetched” on command line using SRA Accession #’s; done within plb812 directory within my plb812 conda environment on the HPCC:
    * T1 Control: prefetch SRR8618232
    * T1 Treatment: prefetch SRR8618235
* SRA accessions were converted to .fastq files:
    * T1 Control: fasterq-dump SRR8618232
    * T1 Treatment: fasterq-dump SRR8618235
    * From each of these commands, two SRR#######.fastq files were generated, each one representing one of the reads from the paired-end reads included in the whole dataset. For instance, for the SRR8618232 (control) accession, the two fastq files generated were: SRR8618232_1.fastq and SRR8618232_2.fastq
* “more” command was used to view the contents of these fastq files and obtain the screenshots
* .fastq files generated were converted to a gzipped format:
    * T1 Control
        * gzip SRR8618232_1.fastq > SRR8618232_1.fastq.gz
        * gzip SRR8618232_2.fastq > SRR8618232_2.fastq.gz
    * T1 Treatment
        * gzip SRR8618235_1.fastq > SRR8618235_1.fastq.gz
        * gzip SRR8618235_2.fastq > SRR8618235_2.fastq.gz
